# Render Slowness - Known Issues

## Problem: Render is Very Slow
Render free tier instances "spin down" after 15 minutes of inactivity. This causes:
- **~50 second delay** on first request after inactivity
- Slow build times consuming all pipeline minutes
- Cold start problems

## Solutions:
1. **Waiting until Nov 1** - Pipeline minutes reset
2. **Manual Deploy** on existing services (might work)
3. **Upgrade to Starter plan** ($7/month) - avoids limits
4. **Alternative hosting** - Railway, Fly.io

## Current Status:
- Backend deployed on: `essence-afirmatii-api.onrender.com`
- Frontend needs to be deployed on Vercel
- All code is functional and tested locally
